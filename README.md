# QRCode Generator
### A QR code (Quick Response code) is a type of two-dimensional matrix barcode, invented in 1994, by Japanese company Denso Wave for labelling automobile parts.A barcode is a machine-readable optical image that contains information specific to the labelled item. In practice, QR codes contain data for a locator, an identifier, and a website visitor tracking.

### A QR code consists of black squares arranged in a square grid on a white background, including some fiducial markers, which can be read by an imaging device such as a camera, and processed using Reedâ€“Solomon error correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted. The required data is then extracted from patterns that are present in both horizontal and vertical components of the image.

### The QR labelling system was applied beyond the automobile industry due to its fast readability and greater storage    capacity compared to standard UPC barcodes. Applications include product tracking, item identification, time tracking, document management, and general marketing.
